// In javascript we have different style use for execution 

-- Direct style 

    It uses return statement in order to process the codes line by line
    it almost look synchronous but sometimes not, for example using return statement
    in asynchronous function

-- Continous Passing Style (CPS)

    It greatly relies on invoking a function inside another function, 
    example, callback -> callback is a function that was passed as an argument to another function
    When invoke in that function it will be a passing style

-- Synchronous 

    This is the process where in all of functions that comes will be read line by line
    or FIFO function execution in the event loop queue, 

-- Asynchronous 

    This is an execution that takes a while, meaning all synchronous function will be prioritize before asynchronous

// 3. Different hashing strategy
// 4. Fs, URL, path, buffer
// 6. Child process
