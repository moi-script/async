• Executing a set of known tasks in sequence, without propagating data across them.
    task1() -> task2() -> task3() -> task4()


• Using the output of a task as the input for the next (also known as chain, pipeline, or waterfall).
    task1(data1, data2) -> task2(data2, data3) -> task3(data3, data4) -> output 


• Iterating over a collection while running an asynchronous task on each element, one after the other.
    task1() [wait] -> task2() [wait] -> task3() [wait] -> task4() [wait]
